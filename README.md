#Scope:

Fine wine is an app that will allow someone that is new to wine or someone that dislikes give it another shot. When the first person logins or signs up it will go to a set of 4 questions which the User will answer and by determining their answer it will show a list of wines that match on the taste they like giving the answers they gave.

I believe that I can get Sprints 1-3 completed with in a week. The hardest part of the project is making the answers match up with the corresponding wines by the information given. And bringing up the location with that specific wine.


#User Stories:

This will be for 21 years old and up. For people new to the wine industry or really donâ€™t know much about and want to learn more about it. The features my app will have is a Home page, login, Sign up page, Questions page, Results page, and info page.

#Future Development:

If I can get the login and sign up to work.
Rating system so where they can save and rate the wines that they try.
Then get a wine API where I can have much more wines list and have more questions.
